# CS330
n completing my 3D scene project, I approached software design with a focus on integrating aesthetic and technical considerations, ensuring the creation of immersive environments using OpenGL. This process honed new skills in shader programming, lighting management, and effective documentation of design decisions. Iterative development was crucial, allowing for continuous refinement of code and the implementation of advanced rendering techniques. Throughout the project, I evolved from foundational OpenGL concepts to confidently applying complex rendering strategies, emphasizing modular code design and collaborative development practices. Looking forward, these experiences in computational graphics not only enhance my educational path with deeper insights into graphics algorithms and virtual environments but also prepare me for professional opportunities in game development, virtual reality, and interactive media, leveraging skills in rendering optimization and 3D modeling essential for future career growth.
